"Developed a robust full-stack shopping cart application using Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic, MongoDB for data storage, and Mongoose for database modeling. The application features user-friendly RESTful APIs, enabling seamless interactions with customers, products, and carts. Implemented dynamic filtering capabilities, allowing users to query and retrieve data based on criteria such as name, email, and product name. This project demonstrates proficiency in web development, database integration, and API design for a modern and efficient shopping experience." For better Understanding, I share Snapshots-
